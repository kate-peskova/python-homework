## Python project, week 2


This python project reads and manipulates the data from a csv file and outputs the results into a separate output.txt file.

The original csv file contans dates and corresponsing profits/losses. The new txt file outputs the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.
* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.


In order to complete the task, I went through the following steps:

1. Read the original csv file and output the result.
2. Looped through the csv file data to calculate the sum of total profits/losses and the total number of periods.
3. Converted csv file into a dictionary to further create a separate lists of dates and profits/losses.
4. Converted a profits/losses list into integers.
5. Iterated through the profits/losses list to create a new list of daily changes and to calculate the average daily change.
6. Combined the lists of dates and changes into a new dictionary.
7. Looped through the dictionary to output the greatest increase and decrease changes with the matching dates.
8. Created the output.txt file with the results.
